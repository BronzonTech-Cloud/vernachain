# Architecture Overview

## Core Components

### Blockchain Core
- **Block Structure**: Implements blocks with transactions, merkle root, and validator signatures
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles transaction validation, execution, and state updates
- **State Management**: Manages account balances, smart contract states, and validator information
- **Consensus**: Implements Proof of Stake consensus with validator selection and rewards

### Sharding System
- **Master Chain**: Coordinates shard chains and cross-shard communication
- **Shard Chains**: Process transactions within individual shards
- **Cross-Shard Communication**: Handles message passing and transaction verification between shards
- **State Synchronization**: Maintains consistency across shards

### Smart Contracts
- **Virtual Machine**: Executes smart contract code in a sandboxed environment
- **Contract State**: Manages contract storage and execution context
- **Gas Metering**: Tracks and limits computational resources
- **Contract Types**:
  - ERC20-like Token Contracts
  - ERC721 NFT Contracts
  - ERC1155 Multi-Token Contracts
  - Custom Contract Templates

### Validator System
- **Stake Management**: Handles validator stakes and delegations
- **Reputation Tracking**: Monitors validator performance and reliability
- **Reward Distribution**: Calculates and distributes block rewards
- **Slashing**: Penalizes malicious or unreliable validators

3. Code execution
4. State updates
5. Event logging
